          <h2>Memorize Key Concepts</h2>
          <p>
            Machine learning/artificial intelligence is a fast moving field. There are thousands of concepts to learn. These flashcards are designed to help you memorize key concepts in machine learning rapidly and enjoyably.

          <h2>Everything From Random Forests To Neural Networks</h2>
          <p>
            Each card covers a single concept -- explaining the fundamental idea or intuition. Concepts range from random forests to deep learning.

          <p>
            Each flashcard is a digital vectorization of a hand-drawn index card, and hopefully more enjoyable to read than a textbook.

          <p>
            The cards are designed to be easily printed two per page with the included PDF file or can be loaded onto your phone, allowing you to carry them around with you anywhere. The cards also come as a Anki deck you can load directly into the free Anki flashcard mobile app.

        <div class="col-sm-12">
          <h3>What comes with my purchase?</h3>
          <p>A zip file containing all flashcards in DRM-free <a href="sample/Dropout.png" alt="Dropout png Sample">png image</a>, <a href="sample/Dropout.pdf" alt="Dropout PDF Sample">PDF</a>, and Anki formats. You will also have free access to any updated or new flashcards forever.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="col-sm-12">
          <h3>Why do you need my email?</h3>
          <p>By entering your email address you are <b>NOT</b> signing up for a marketing newsletter.</p>
          <p>Your email is your unique login giving you access to the cards in the future. If a year from now you want to download the latest cards, just login using your email.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="col-sm-12">
          <h3>Can I get physical flashcards?</h3>
          <p>No, but not due to lack of trying. This is a small side project, and inquiries to printing companies made it clear selling physical cards would be incredibly costly (one printer quoted me $45 per deck) and would require me to manage inventory and shipping. So unfortunately I cannot sell any physical cards.
        </div>

        <div class="col-sm-12">
          <h3>How should I use the flashcards?</h3>
          <p>I recommend three options:</p>

          <ol>
            <li>Print them as flashcards by printing them two per regular sized printer page</li>
            <li>Load them onto your iPhone or Android as a gallery of images, then swipe through them whenever you are bored. This is what I do.</li>
            <li>Import them into any Anki flashcard app for two sided digital flashcards with spaced reptition.</li>
          </ol>
        </div>
        
        <div class="col-sm-12">
          <h3>How can I expense the flashcards?</h3>
          <p>Send me an email at cralbon a.t. gmail com for a professional invoice.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="col-sm-12">
          <h3>Can I use these flashcards for my art project?</h3>
          <p>Absolutely! Want to use the art for a custom bed sheet, towel, skirt or something else? Go right ahead. I just ask that you don't sell it.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="col-sm-12">
          <h3>What if I find an error?</h3>
          <p>Despite my best efforts, there will be errors in the cards. If you find an error, send me <a href="https://twitter.com/chrisalbon">a message on Twitter</a>  and I will fix it.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="col-sm-12">
          <h3>Why did you make these flashcards?</h3>
          <p>I made them because when I was (and still am) learning machine learning, I found it incredibly helpful to memorize concepts explicitly rather than reading books and hoping concepts stuck.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="col-sm-12">
          <h3>Who made these?</h3>
          <p>I did! Chris Albon. You can <a href="https://twitter.com/chrisalbon">find me on Twitter</a>.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="col-sm-12">
          <h3>Will machine learning flashcards still appear on Twitter?</h3>
          <p>Yes! Although I make no guarantees about repeated cards or the most up-to-date version of a card being posted.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="col-sm-12">
          <h3>What if I cannot afford the flash cards?</h3>
          <p>If you cannot afford the cards, send me a DM on Twitter or an email to &#099;&#114;&#097;&#108;&#098;&#111;&#110;&#064;&#103;&#109;&#097;&#105;&#108;&#046;&#099;&#111;&#109; and I will send you a 100% coupon code no questions asked.</p>
